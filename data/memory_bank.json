      "action": "BUY 11 shares",
      "reasoning": "The IRCTC stock has shown a strong bullish reversal over the past few periods, recovering significantly from its recent low of \u20b9818.72. Today's price action reinforces this upward momentum, with the stock currently trading near its daily high (\u20b9885.34 vs. High \u20b9892.98) and a positive change of nearly 1.9%. While the volume today is slightly lower than previous high-volume days, it is still substantial enough to support the upward movement. There are no negative news catalysts to contradict this positive trend. I believe the short-term momentum is strong and that the stock is likely to continue its upward trajectory, potentially testing higher resistance levels. Buying 11 shares utilizes almost all available capital, capitalizing on this perceived strong trend.",

      "action": "BUY 9 shares",
      "reasoning": "IRCTC is exhibiting a strong and sustained bullish trend, consistently making higher highs over the past several periods. The current price of \u20b91084.01 represents a new high within the observed historical data, supported by a significant percentage change (3.33%) and decent volume. The previous day saw a substantial surge with high volume, indicating strong buying interest that is carrying over. While buying at new highs carries inherent risk, the momentum is clearly to the upside, suggesting a continuation of the rally. The current price is consolidating near the day's high, which is a bullish sign. I am leveraging the available capital to participate in this upward movement.",
